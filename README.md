# SEB-Project-Based-Internship
🤝Is there any better opportunity for honing customer-centric experience skills?🏦
One of the brightest highlights during my studies at University of Tartu was project-based internship with SEB. My team and I had an outstanding opportunity to transform acquired knowledge into range of practical skills and competences. 

During the internship we identified key bottlenecks of the robo-advisory prototype and proposed step-by-step plan to fix them, based on benchmarking results. The results of our 4 months of hard work is atteached here, so you can familiarise yourself with what we did.
